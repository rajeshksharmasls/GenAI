(august/2004); i had to adjust the ingredients, of course, to serve 150 people. preparation was a fun exercise; the prepared salmon was cooked on a 5 ft. length, 2"" x 10"", water-soaked, cedar plank and placed on a large, propane-fired grill. the end result was a perfectly seasoned, delightfully flavoured, lightly smoked salmon that had the wedding guests returning to the buffet table, repeatedly, until all 24 salmon fillets had been devoured. when purchasing your salmon, have the fish-monger filet the fish, remove the skin and pin bones.... when you have purchased your cedar plank, soak the plank in cold water, overnight. place the plank in a container of water, with a rock or brick on the plank to keep it submerged. soaking the plank will keep it from burning during the cooking process. not soaking it gives the salmon a stronger, smoky taste. remember, this is not only a recipe, it is also a cooking lesson, so have patience and you will be pleased with the results. follow the instructions carefully, and you cannot fail. it is a wonderful recipe, the end result will amaze you and your guests praise you.","['cedar planks', 'salmon', 'vegetable oil', 'dark amber maple syrup', 'canadian rye whisky', 'butter', 'maple sugar', 'coarse sea salt', 'fresh ground pepper', 'fresh thyme', 'mayonnaise', 'apple butter', 'fresh tarragon']",13

angel food cake is also called ice cream cake (a pennsylvania dutch wedding cake). it is felt that the abundance of cake molds in southeastern pennsylvania, one of the major producer of cake molds, indicates that the angel food cake originated there in the early 1800s.
some historians think that the first angel food cakes were probably baked by african-american slaves from the south because making this cake required a strong beating arm and lots of labor to whip the air into the whites. angel food cakes are also a traditional african-american favorite for post-funeral feasting.","['egg whites', 'cake flour', 'granulated sugar', 'salt', 'cream of tartar', 'vanilla extract', 'almond extract', 'candy sprinkles']",8

you can make it without the palm oil. this ingredient is common in northern brazil. it gives food a special flavour and colour. there is no substitute. you can find it in markets that specialise in brazilian imports. the recipe works without it (i tried it that way on purpose), but if you can get it, palm oil is a wonderful addition.

for those not familiar with thai food, chicken satay consists of marinated strips of chicken breast, skewered, grilled and served with a delicious, somewhat spicy, peanut sauce. they are ubiquitous not only in thai restaurants in the us, but in thailand itself - where they are sold by street vendors for ridiculously low prices. 
when we visited thailand, we were amazed at how much the food served there tasted like the food served at thai restaurants in america. this is not always the case - cambodian food in the us, for example, rarely resembles what's available there. i don't know if this is because thai recipes have become standardized, or because the basic ingredients produce dishes of similar taste regardless of proportions or other ingredients. in any case, we found that this recipe for chicken satay produced a dish that tasted pretty much exactly like the chicken satay served at thai restaurants here and in thailand. needless to say, it was very good. 
you should be able to buy the necessary ingredients at specialized asian markets. thai red curry was not available at my local safeway, but i could find it easily at a local asian market. note that fish sauce usually comes in huge bottles, you only need a little bit, so try to buy the smallest size you can. the stuff is very smelly, but wonderful when mixed with the other ingredients. 
for my party, i tripled the recipe i'm including here. this was fine for the chicken itself, but it produced way too much peanut sauce. one recipe of peanut sauce would have been enough.","['boneless skinless chicken breast', 'coconut milk', 'fish sauce', 'red curry paste', 'palm sugar', 'cilantro', 'ground turmeric', 'salt & freshly ground black pepper', 'bamboo skewer']",9

added comment (oct 2008): thanks to all the reviewers for their comments and photos. first, many of the recipes from eileen yin-fei lo's book are her remembrances of her family's (especially her aunt's) home cooking in rural china, very traditional ... so modern taste would definitely think about adding to the spectrum of spices used in this recipe. i think she would approve of changes to reflect individual palates. second, looking at the sodium content of the analysis, i agree that getting 32% of your rda in one dish is a bit much ... you could reduce the amount of soy sauce, but if you do, you might want to increase either the wine or oyster sauce (or just add water) to maintain the liquid volume ... i'd think first of reducing the 1/2 tsp salt directly and then reducing the soy if i needed more salt removed ....","['chicken cutlet', 'fresh lemon juice', 'fresh lemon', 'ginger juice', 'shaoxing wine', 'light soy sauce', 'oyster sauce', 'salt', 'sugar', 'sesame oil', 'peanut oil', 'white pepper', 'cornstarch', 'red bell peppers']",14

update:2-25-09 i made these today and i used caned chicken instead of regular chicken and it worked reall well. it didnt change the points at all according to the recipe builder on ww online. i used whole wheat tortillas and those made my points go up by 2.(so 4 in total) which still wasnt bad. these are pretty good and fast to make.i was gonna have one and a piece of fruit but the wrap was filling enough. i couldnt find the fat free cream cheese in the garden veggie flavor so i used regular fat free.
update! 3-02-09 made these again(lol) still used the plain cream cheese, ff, but instead of sprinkling with the cayenne pepper, i used italian seasoning and garlic powder! it was delicious! i wont use the cayenne again the italian seasoning is the best! feel free to change the seasoning up a bit and let me know how you did it!:)","['boneless skinless chicken breast halves', 'nonfat chicken broth', 'low-fat flour tortillas', 'fat-free cream cheese with garden vegetables', 'garlic powder', 'salt', 'cayenne pepper', 'coleslaw mix', 'green bell pepper']",9
